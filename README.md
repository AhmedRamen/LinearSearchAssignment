# Linear Search Algorithm
This is an assignment that takes a value from the array we specifiy and check if the number exists in this array, otherwise it doesn't exist and we return a -1. The algorithm is very basic and somewhat 'bloated', but I do personally think it can be optimised, thus improving it altogether.
### Output window:
```
Searching for 420...
Matching found! Element 9: 420
